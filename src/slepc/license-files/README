Overview
--------

SLEPc, the Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations, is a software
package for  the  solution of *large sparse eigenvalue problems*  on  parallel
computers. It  can be used for the solution of problems formulated  in  either
standard  or  generalized form, as well as other related problems such as  the
singular value decomposition and the nonlinear eigenproblem.

The  emphasis  of the software is on methods and  techniques  appropriate  for
problems in which the  associated matrices are sparse. Therefore, most of  the
methods offered by the library are projection methods such as Krylov-Schur  or
Jacobi-Davidson. It also provides built-in support for spectral transformation
such as shift-and-invert.

SLEPc is built on top of PETSc_ the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
Computation.  It  can be considered an extension of PETSc  providing  all  the
functionality necessary for the solution of eigenvalue problems.

Documentation
-------------

The  Users Manual as well as the HTML man pages for the detailed reference  of
each individual SLEPc routines are included in the SLEPc distribution and  can
also be found at the SLEPc `online documentation`_.

The  main reference for SLEPc is the following paper (see other references  at
the SLEPc website):

Installation
------------

The installation procedure of SLEPc is very similar to that of PETSc. Briefly,
the environment variables ``$SLEPC_DIR`` and ``$PETSC_DIR`` must be set,  then
the script ``configure`` is executed and finally the libraries are built  with
the command ``make``. More details can be found in the Users Manual or in  the
online `installation instructions`_.
